Welcome to the Declarative UI Docs. The goal of this documentation is to make switching between declarative ui frameworks easy. It is also helpful to compare different concepts and similarities to learn from each other.

# What is declarative ui

Declarative UI is an approach to building user interfaces that focuses on describing what the interface should look like, rather than the step-by-step process of how to create it. In this paradigm, developers define the desired end result, and the underlying framework or library takes care of rendering the UI based on that description.

With declarative UI, developers express the UI in terms of a set of components and their properties. These components can be nested and composed together to create complex interfaces. Rather than manually manipulating the UI elements, developers simply declare the desired state, and the framework handles the updates and re-rendering.

One of the key advantages of declarative UI is its ability to provide a clear separation between the UI logic and the application state. This makes it easier to reason about and maintain the codebase. Additionally, since the framework handles the rendering optimizations, it can automatically handle UI updates efficiently, resulting in improved performance.

Declarative UI has gained popularity in recent years, with frameworks like React and SwiftUI leading the way. These frameworks enable developers to create UIs for web and mobile applications using a declarative approach. By leveraging the power of declarative UI, developers can build interfaces more efficiently, iterate faster, and create more robust applications.
